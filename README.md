# Major Assignment: Data Structure 2 (DS2)
Problem 1: Greedy Algorithm
Description: Given N meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i]), where start[i] is the start time of meeting i and end[i] is the finish time of meeting i. Determine the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room when only one meeting can be held at a particular time.

Your Task: Implement the function maxMeetings(start[], end[], N) which returns the maximum number of meetings that can be held in the meeting room.

Problem 2: Greedy Algorithm
Description: Given a set of N jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated with it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit. Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Job id, Deadline, Profit).

Your Task: Implement the function JobScheduling(N, jobs[]) which returns the count of jobs and maximum profit.

Problem 3: Dynamic Programming
Description: Repeat Problem 2 using Dynamic Programming.

Your Task: Implement the solution using Dynamic Programming.

Problem 4: Greedy Algorithm
Description: Given N pairs of numbers where each pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if b < c. Find the longest chain which can be formed from the given set of pairs.

Your Task: Implement the function maxChainLen(p[], n) which returns the length of the longest chain formed.

Problem 5: Dynamic Programming
Description: Repeat Problem 4 using Dynamic Programming.

Problem 6: Backtracking
Description: Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at (N - 1, N - 1). Find all possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination.

Your Task: Implement the function printPath(N, m[][]) which returns the list of paths in lexicographically increasing order.

Problem 7: Backtracking
Description: Given an undirected graph and an integer M. Determine if the graph can be colored with at most M colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color.

Your Task: Implement the function graphColoring(graph[][], colors, nodes) which returns true if it's possible to color vertices and false otherwise.

Problem 8: Backtracking
Description: Given a string S containing only digits. Generate all possible combinations of valid IPv4 IP addresses.

Your Task: Implement the function genIp(S) which returns a vector containing all possible combinations of valid IPv4 IP addresses or -1 if no such IP address could be generated through the input string.

Problem 9: Backtracking
Description: Given a dictionary of distinct words and an M x N board where every cell has one character. Find all possible words from the dictionary that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters on the board.

Your Task: Implement the function wordBoggle(dictionary[], board[R][C]) which returns a list of words that exist on the board in lexicographical order.

Problem 10: Divide and Conquer
Description: Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. Find the element that would be at the kth position of the final sorted array.

Your Task: Implement the function kthElement(arr1[], arr2[], N, M, K) which returns the element at the Kth position.

Problem 11: Divide and Conquer
Description: You have N books, each with A[i] number of pages. M students need to be allocated contiguous books, with each student getting at least one book. Find the permutation where the sum of the maximum number of pages in a book allotted to a student should be minimum.

Your Task: Implement the function findPages(N, M, A[]) which returns the expected answer.

Problem 12: Divide and Conquer
Description: Given two integers m and n, try making a special sequence of numbers seq of length n such that seq[i+1] >= 2 * seq[i], seq[i] > 0, and seq[i] <= m. Determine the total number of such special sequences possible.

Your Task: Implement the function numberSequence(m, n) which returns the number of possible special sequences.

### How you can Execute Code:
You may need to integrate various libraries into your computer to run the program. For example: #include <bits/stdc++.h>. If you encounter an error like "#include <bits/stdc++.h> not found", search on Google and get the necessary integration on your computer.

To execute the code, clone the entire GitHub project to your computer. Then paste the codes into the IDE you want.
